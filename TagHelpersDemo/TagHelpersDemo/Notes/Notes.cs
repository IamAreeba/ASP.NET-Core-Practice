/*
 *  Creating HyperLinks using Tag Helpers
 * 
 *  In MVC 5: HTML Helpers : They are methods 
 *  In .NET: Tag Helpers : To render HTML on server side: They are attributes
 *  When we use HTML Helpers it renders the HTML on the server side cuz .NET Core works on the server side
 *  
 *  Diff btw @HTML.ActionLink and @Url.Action ? 
 *  @HTML.ActionLink generate the whole anchor | @Url.Action generates the href not the whole a
 *  
 *  When we click on any Link an Id is generated and that Id will take us to View 
 *  We usually do the Id work with Edit or Delete
