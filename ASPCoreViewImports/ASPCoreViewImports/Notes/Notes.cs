/*
 * You just have to give class name in top of Views file.
 * Namespace of class is written in _ViewImports File cuz this file is connected with every view

 * If we have to register any directives or namespace globally whic is shared among all view we use _ViewImports file 
 * directives: @using
 * We can make multiple _ViewImports files
